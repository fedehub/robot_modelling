<h1>MoveIt</h1>

A brief overview about MoveIt!




# MoveIt configuration

# Some remarks

Please note that any implementation of the moveit configuration has been made through a specific version (1.15) of the framework itself. This is the same employed for the **Experimental Robotics Laboratory course** and it is employed within the package [explab_2nd][1]

⚠️ if you have used `apt-get ...` for downloading [MoveIt][4], please run the script `moveit_fixer.py`, where all the instructions needed for obtaining the 1.15 moveit framework, have been provided (thanks to [Professor Recchiuto](https://github.com/CarmineD8) )

```sh

chmod +x moveit_fixer.py
./moveit_fixer.py

```
